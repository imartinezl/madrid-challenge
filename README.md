# Open Data Challenge - Optimization of glass recollection in Madrid Central

This repo contains the code for an open data challenge promoted by [Kopuru](http://kopuru.com/).

The [challenge](http://kopuru.com/desafio/reto-open-data-optimizacion-de-la-recogida-de-vidrio-en-madrid-central/) here is to calculate and show on a map which is the shortest route for the collection of glass containers within the district of Madrid Central. In doing so, we could help the City Council of Madrid through the use of data to improve the service to its citizens.


## Challenge Objectives

- To create a visualization platform that delimits the area of Central Madrid and collects the geolocation of the different types of containers.

- To calculate and visualize the route to be followed identifying the starting point, route, end point and distance travelled.

## General Idea

So, this is actually not a big deal. First we will create a model of the system resembling the very well known TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem). Then, we will choose one of the available optimization methods to solve the TSP problem. More details below.

## Data Adquisition

## Data Preprocessing

## Container Visualization

## Route Optimization
